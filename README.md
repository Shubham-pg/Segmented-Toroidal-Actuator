This invention introduces a curved hydraulic cylinder for hinge actuation in limited spaces, overcoming differential circular motion issues in conventional linear cylinder setups. It features a solid segmented toroidal inner rod, a shorter segmented toroidal piston, a unique three-seal placement, and a conical roller with a cage structure for smooth piston gliding. The design overcomes issues such as telescopic piston banking, seal wear, and large fluid volume requirements in heavier cylinders while achieving up to 180Â° motion.

## WORKING PRINCIPLE
This hydraulic cylinder actuator mechanism provides motion on a circular trajectory using hydraulic pressure. 

Its working principle is based on a typical hydraulic cylinder actuator, where a hydraulic pump delivers pressurized fluid between the piston and cylinder chamber, causing it to expand. The expanding chamber motion is taken as the movement of the piston, thus serving as the actuator's output.

---

## BASIC METHODOLOGY OF OPERATION AND WORKING

The hydraulic fluid is pumped into **hole1**, appearing in the chamber between the piston and inner rod on one side of the piston, causing expansion. As a result, the flange attached to the piston moves on a circular track, creating a **forward stroke** of the actuator mechanism.

Similarly, when fluid is pumped into **hole2** (while keeping hole1 at zero pressure to drain the accumulated fluid), it causes expansion in the opposite chamber, producing the **backward stroke**.

## APPLICATIONS

### Heavy Dumping Equipment
The **curved hydraulic cylinder** avoids the **entanglement of telescopic hydraulic cylinders** under tangential forces, ensuring a rigid structure confined to its trajectory, capable of bearing significant loads.

![Telescopic Cylinder Failure](placeholder_failure.png)

This entanglement can be avoided using our design, which can bear **significant tangential forces**.

### Extended Motion to Hinge
Conventional hydraulic cylinders for gate and door actuation are limited to **90 degrees**, while our **curved hydraulic cylinder** allows motion up to **180 degrees**.

![180-degree extension](placeholder_180_degree.png)

### Direct Hinge and Actuator Replacement
Instead of a hinge, our system allows the **piston itself to work as an actuator**, eliminating gears and increasing durability.

### Heavy Actuation of Bunker Gates
Traditional heavy hydraulic cylinders fail due to **piston banking** under its own weight. Our design can withstand high tangential and actuating loads without failure.

## HYDRAULIC SYSTEM
The hydraulic fluid chamber is formed **between the inner rod and the inner surface of the piston**, sealed by oil seals to prevent leakage.

### Hydraulic System Components
![Hydraulic Components](placeholder_hydraulic_components.png)

Hydraulic fluid is pumped into **hole1**, creating forward motion. Then, fluid is pumped into **hole2**, causing backward motion.
